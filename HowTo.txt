   * Type 1 to display all arrived flights.
   * Type 2 for all delayed flights.
   * Type 3 for all flights for a country (remember to enter the airport ICAO code).
   * Type 4 for details of a specific flight (enter the flight ICAO code).

it will end the connection and display on the server that the client (Ex, Malak) has disconnected.
